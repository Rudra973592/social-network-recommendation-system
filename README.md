# social-network-recommendation-system
My first data science project using Python and JSON data

In this project, I worked with a JSON dataset that simulates a small social network.
I built two recommendation systems:

1. People You May Know  
   → suggests users based on mutual friends.

2. Pages You May Like  
   → suggests pages based on similar interests.

Concepts used:
- JSON data handling
- Python dictionaries and sets
- Loops and functions
- Basic recommendation logic

This project helped me understand how real platforms like Facebook or LinkedIn
can build simple recommendation features.
